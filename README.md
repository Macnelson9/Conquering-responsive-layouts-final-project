## Overview

This is a solution to the final challenge of the 21-day Conquering Responsive Layout Course by Kevin Powell. It is meant to test and improve responsive web developent skills as well as writing Semantic HTML skills.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the design no matter what device they're using.
- See hover states for interactive elements

### What I learnt

- I learnt that websites are alredy responsive before we even apply any styles on them, meaning that we are the ones who make them unrepsonsive by complicating codes.
- I learnt how to write mobile-first CSS, which is something that I've been looking forward to learning.
